Python function to store bulk sms messages to AWS SQS for 1 per second sending.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 (update `serverless.yml` if higher version is desired)
* Pip
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm
* [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)
* [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Setup Instructions
Clone this repo from GitHub, and navigate into the newly created directory to proceed.

### Environment
Rename `.env.default` to `.env` and add values to `VONAGE_API_KEY` and `VONAGE_API_SECRET` provided by your Vonage Video APIs account.

### AWS Setup
You will need to create [AWS credentials](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/) as indicated by Serverless. Update the `.env` file with these.

Also, create a new [SQS FIFO queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) using the default settings, and update `.env` with the SQS queue URL. By using FIFO, it ensures messages are sent in the order they were stored.

### Usage
To start, create a virtualenv from within the project root to contain the project as you proceed. Then activate it as follows:

```bash
virtualenv venv --python=python3
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, initialize npm and follow the prompts selecting the defaults. Unless you desire to change any of them. Also, use npm to install needed dependencies for dev to enable Serverless and Lambda to work with the Flask app.

```bash
npm init
npm install --save-dev serverless-wsgi serverless-python-requirements
```

Now you can use pip to install the required Python dependencies. The dependencies are already listed in the requirements.txt, so instruct pip to use it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running Local
You can run the app locally and test things out, prior to deploying to AWS Lambda, you can serve it with the following command:

```bash
sls wsgi serve
```

By default this will serve the app at http://localhost:5000. Hitting `Ctrl+c` will close it down.

#### Deploy to Lambda
With all the above finished successfully, you can now use Serverless to deploy the app to AWS Lambda.

```bash
sls deploy
```

#### Available Endpoints
There are 4 URL endpoints available with this client:

* GET request to `/`
    - Doesn't perform any actions, but provides a quick way to test

* POST request to `/add`
    - This will store the message in SQS.
    - Pass a POST with a JSON body like the following. Substitute the placeholders, indicated with `<>` with your data.
    - The result will be contain the SQS `MessageId`.

```json
{
    "from": "<your_name_or_number>",
    "message": "<sms_message_contents>",
    "to": "<recipients_number>"
}
```
    
* GET request to `/process`
    - Kicks off the sending process.
    - Retrieves the message from SQS FIFO queue.
    - Connects to Nexmo, and sends the SMS message.
    
```text
location=None, media_mode=relayed, archive_mode=manual
```

##### Examples:
Go to the URL provided by the deploy process. Below are some examples of what sample requests may look like: (Your URL will vary.)

GET `https://7ulasfasdasdfw4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/`

The `/` endpoint returns the generic message.

POST `https://7ulasfasdasdfw4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/add`

The `add` endpoint will return the SQS `MessageId`.

GET `https://7ulasfasdasdfw4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/process`

The `process` endpoing will return a message indicating a successful send.

#### Deactivating Virtualenv
To exit the virtualenv you can deactivate it, when desired.

```bash
deactivate
```

NOTE: Depending on OS, you may need to prepend `virtualenv` to the command above.
